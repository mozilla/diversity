## My thoughts on [Issue #95](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/95)

### Clarity for use of fields - 'Gender Identity' and 'Transgender'

  I think the questions labeled 'Gender Identity' and 'Transgender' should be two individual questions as they can be used by an organization to deduce separate analysis results. According to the best practices doc if we don't require an information, we don't ask for it.
But I believe, while collecting demographic data and performing analysis over it, the purpose is mostly to understand the implications of a gender on various things, rather than the Biological term associated with it. I think both the questions are inclusive of each other if we want to understand the gender-identity in a wholesome manner. But nonetheless, if a single answer suffices we shouldn't ask for the second information.

On saying that, this is exactly how 'Gender Identity' and 'Transgender' pose two different questions, and one is important to understand the other and they might be dynamic and subject to changes as well. As quoted from [APA](http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx)

>Gender identity and sexual orientation are not the same. Sexual orientation refers to an individual’s enduring physical, romantic, and/or emotional attraction to another person, whereas gender identity refers to one’s internal sense of being male, female, or something else. Transgender people may be straight, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or asexual, just as nontransgender people can be. Some recent research has shown that a change or a new exploration period in partner attraction may occur during the process of transition.

Also it is important to mention what we mean by gender-identity. There is subtle difference between the terms, sex and gender.
>Sex is assigned at birth, refers to one’s biological status as either male or female, and is associated primarily with physical attributes such as chromosomes, hormone prevalence, and external and internal anatomy. Gender refers to the socially constructed roles, behaviors, activities, and attributes that a given society considers appropriate for boys and men or girls and women. These influence the ways that people act, interact, and feel about themselves. While aspects of biological sex are similar across different cultures, aspects of gender may differ.

Thus, though 'sex' is irrespective of the understanding of orientation, 'gender' has broader grips. Sex identity is a biological fact and cannot have deviations but that is not the case with gender identity. If we do ask about gender identity, it might be important to understand if someone is transgender or not, and there also should be a case to fit in the people who are not sure of the answer. Nonetheless, one should keep in mind that all three can act as separate individual questions and no questions should be asked without a need for it.
