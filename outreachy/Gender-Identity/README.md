# Gender Identity

There are two parts of this task.
Aspirants should look at [Gender Identity](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/data-metrics/surveys/en/gender-identity.md) 
and [Best Practices](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/blob/master/data-metrics/surveys/best-practices-diverse-data.md)
## Legal Concerns (age)
The detail about that best practices doc was being asked: we can’t ask gender identity for people under 19.
which might need some substantiation.

Why 19? COPPA applies in the US for <13s, and that’s definitely the general rule.
This would mean that we couldn’t ask a college freshman who wanted to live in a single-sex dorm their sex.
If we’re going to state things like that strongly, presumably we should have a pretty good logic for doing so and 
be transparent about that and the aspirants should research about the reason that goes behind this.

For more, have a look at Issue [#96](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/96) here.

## Clarity for use of fields

Gender Identity has two questions, one labelled Gender Identity and one labeled Transgender. 
They should research about the implication that if one asks one, one should ask the other?
They could have a look at best practices doc which makes it very clear that one shouldn’t ask without a good reason, but putting the two
after each other might suggest that.

For more, have a look at Issue [#95](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity/issues/95) here.
