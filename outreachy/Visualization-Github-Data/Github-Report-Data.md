# Open Source Data Visualization

As a contributor to the Diversity team of Mozilla I have analyzed how users engage with their Open Source community. I have seen what is the gender spread across communities, their contributions on Github aing with their Employment status. The data was extracted from Github's Open Source survey from 2017.

## Users who value cost

It seems that cost plays a major part of selecting a project.

There were a total of 4126 Users on which the survey did not have a NaN value. Out of those, 3648 people value the cost of the project which makes around 88.4% of the users.

## Github Users by Gender

It seems that the gender distribution among Github users is not that evenly distributed as 95.4 % of total Github users are men.

## Employment Status of People
Full time Employed users tend to use Github more than any other users. This indicates that organisations, nowadays, are moving towards Open Source.

Another aspect which can be looked at is the number of users on Github.

The Pie-Chart very well represents that Github is used by64.1% full time employed users.

Also, when looked at full time employed users, we can see that women constitute only 3.5% of the total users.


We shall now see how much does women contribute in code.

It is saddening to see that only 32.4% of the total women contribute Frequently. To solifdify if we are heading right, lets see the total number of users about whom we are talking about. There seem to be data of only about 74 women, so this measure may not be an accurate way to come to a conclusion.

## Where do people get help

When analysed, it was seen that 56.0% people got help from people that they never knew before.

##Conclusion
In the end I conclude that the percentage of Women in OSS is way behind that of men. Also, OSS seems to be a friendly environment as people get help from others whom they have not known before. This creates a platform for women to come and showcase their skills.
