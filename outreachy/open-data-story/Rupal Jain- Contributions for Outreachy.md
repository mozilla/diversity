Hi,

I am **Rupal Jain**. I am a contributor to "Diversity and Inclusion" project for Outreachy 2018.

Till date, I have prepared 4 contributions for the issue: "Tell your Open Data Story".

#### I am attaching all of them in one Pull Request only.

I have done data analysis on 4 different datasets and have produced useful insights from it.

I am attaching the links to all of those analysis here:
