## Survey

### Your Place on the Web & In the World

1. Which Open Source project is your primary place for contribution/community participation?
Please use textboxes to indicate a specific initiative within i.e. Mozilla - Firefox


2. On which geographic region do you live? To protect your privacy we are limiting our geographic question to continent (instead of country), which will still help us understand how global location influences experiences in open source.
