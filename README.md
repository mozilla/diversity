# Open Innovation - Diversity & Inclusion

Welcome to Diversity & Inclusion at Mozilla! We welcome all contributors and are eager to work with you, but due to the highly confidential nature of much of our work, we currently only have occasional tasks available for non-staff contributors. 

Please follow the repository to get notified when we have tasks - we use the "contributors wanted" label for tasks that non-staff can take on. If you don't see this label or the task is assigned directly to someone, please assume it's staff-only.

If you're interested in contributing to Mozilla projects that have more tasks available, you might find [this Telegram page](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Telegram) useful to find contributor discussion channels. Most channels can help suggest places to contribute. We recommend WoMoz and Mozillians if you're not sure where to start.

[Please review the Community Participation Guidelines before participating](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/)   

[We track tasks using Zenhub](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/mozilla/diversity/boards?repos=77927559).
